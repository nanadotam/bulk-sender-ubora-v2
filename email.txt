The Prestige of Ubora

How to get there:
Ubora is our annual “we see you” moment. The university uses this night to honour students who’ve shown real growth, real contribution, and real impact. No pretence. No fluff. Just people who’ve earned their spotlight.
Best photo tip:
Get your shots early in the night during the red carpet... That means coming early...side-eyeing some of you 👀


The Fashion Moment: What to Wear
Let’s be real — that’s the only reason some of us are going...



Let’s be honest — we ALL can’t afford to drop half our allowance on an outfit for one night. And that’s okay. That’s exactly why this year’s dress code is simple black tie: clean, elegant and affordable without the pressure to overdo it. No need for designer labels. Just a well-put-together look that makes you feel confident and classy.
For the ladies:
A sleek black dress or a simple evening gown will carry you far. Keep it elegant with smooth fabrics, minimal accessories and a soft glam makeup look.
For the gentlemen:
A clean suit with a crisp shirt instantly aligns with the theme. Add a tie, polish your shoes and make sure everything fits you well. You don’t need a tuxedo to look sharp. Just show up neat, intentional and tailored.
The goal:  We want the room to look cohesive, elevated and elegant… without anyone going broke to make it happen. And trust — when everyone sticks to black tie, the photos? Unreal.

What to Look Forward To



Ubora is an experience layered with moments you’ll remember:
Live performances that elevate the room
A beautifully staged ambience worthy of the theme
Powerful speeches capturing the heart of Ashesi excellence
The Glam Photobooth experience for premium take-home memories
Red carpet moments that become instant social-media gold
A gathering of the entire community — leaders, learners, creatives, achievers
It’s the kind of night where every turn gives you something new to admire.

Why Your Presence Matters
Beyond the glamour and the photos, there’s a deeper reason to be there: your presence contributes to the energy of the night. Celebrating someone’s hard work is a powerful act. Showing up for your community is even more impactful.
And, honestly? There’s nothing worse than sitting at home, watching snaps and hearing people talk about the experience you missed — but they definitely start with a ticket.
